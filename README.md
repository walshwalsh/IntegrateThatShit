# IntegrateThatShit
For chemical process design: mass integration, heat integration, other.

# Instructions
The file proc_design.py contains function definitions. The file integration_script_template.py demonstrates how to use the functions in a simple script. CSV data files are passed as arguments into the functions - these must both be correctly formatted and stored in the same directory as proc_design.py and the scripting file. For any function, results are created in output_file.csv, which can be opened with a text editor or excel for plebs.
